- alive daemon: make a separate daemon, that checks whether all processes that
  should be running, are running and working correctly.

- submit_copy hack: the submit_copy.sh script is a hack, because at our contest
  the homedirectory under Windows (Cygwin) and Linux were different. Maybe
  implement configurable option for multiple home-directory locations?

- submit input: submit normally requires the user to press a key to aknowlegde
  submission. This should be implemented more portable to allow porting the
  submit program to other platforms. (Client side only needs submit and
  webbrowser, so that's fairly portable).

- error beeps: at the moment, sounds are programmed for errors, submission and
  judging with correct/incorrect result. This helps the jury keep informed, but
  gives a lot of beeping noise, especially during submission errors by
  contestants. Maybe reduce the number of events for beeping errors?

- jury interface features: add possibility to change more using the jury interface.

- mass rejudging: add rejudging possibility per problem/judger/language.

- clarification request read: make option to mark clarification requests as read
  even if no response on these has been sent. (e.g. when a general response to
  multiple requests has been sent).
