General
-------
- Handtweaking is still necesary when installing domserver and
  judgedaemon on the same host. Fix that.


Domserver
---------
- Using dbconfig-common seems a lot better than to set things up
  ourselves with dj-setup-database, but is it flexible enough? 
  Current way is fragile and asks for mysql root pw in inconvenient
  / illegal way.
- Move not-directly-called stuff out of PATH or /etc.
- Do some apache configuration.

Judgehost
---------
- Add compilers to debian/control
- Do we need to deal with Java chroot differently?
- Place correct database configuration.
- Is there a sensible way for the init script to stop judgedaemon?
- Whole initscript-business is suboptimal as it can't detect errors.
  Judgedaemon should be a proper daemon? Possible with php?
- Why is runguard in /usr/bin? It's never called directly.
- We really should use dbconfig-common to set up the database.
- Do something with sudo configuration.
