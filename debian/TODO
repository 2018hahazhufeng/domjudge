General
-------
Domserver and judgedaemon cannot be installed on the same host,
because of /etc/domjudge/common-config.php that is in both.
How to solve this? Create /etc/domjudge/{judgehost,domserver}/
dirs? Is it worthwhile to make a domjudge-common package containing
all overlapping files?


Domserver
---------
- Using dbconfig-common seems a lot better than to set things up
  ourselves with dj-setup-database, but is it flexible enough? 
  Current way is fragile and asks for mysql root pw in inconvenient
  / illegal way.
- Move not-directly-called stuff out of PATH or /etc.
- Apache configuration.

Judgehost
---------
- Add compilers to debian/control
- How to deal with Java chroot. Plan: test if exists, if not,
  ask to create now or provide instruction to create later
- Place correct database configuration
- Is there a sensible way for the init script to stop judgedaemon?
- Whole initscript-business is suboptimal as it can't detect errors.
- Why is runguard in /usr/bin? It's never called directly.
- We really should use dbconfig-common to set up the database.
