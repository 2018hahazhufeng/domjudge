DOMjudge Programming Contest Judging System

Version 0.2.0 - CVS
-------------------
 - Fixed faulty EPS-logo, finally.
 - Add database privileges and move sql-files to own directory.
 - Improve config.tex dependency.
 - Make the base URI of the webinterface configurable and fix redirects
   to be compatible with the HTTP-specification.
 - Fix bug in getSubmissions() that caused a syntax error on the
   team-overview in the jury interface.
 - Added some notes on security to the INSTALL docs.
 - Symbolic links now included (subversion >= 1.1)
 - Fixed buffer size bug in log/error C-code.

 - In tables, the time is now printed as hh:mm (without seconds).
