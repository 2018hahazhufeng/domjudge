Thank you for suggesting ways to improve DOMjudge. Before you file a feature
request, it might be useful to discuss it first via
[our discussion channel](https://www.domjudge.org/chat) or send an email to our
[DOMjudge-devel mailinglist](https://www.domjudge.org/mailman/postorius/lists/domjudge-devel.domjudge.org/). We can then assess together whether there is
not already a way to accomplish your goal with DOMjudge currently.

When filing a request, make sure to not only describe a concrete change but
also the larger goal you want to achieve, so we have a good understanding
what this feature would be useful for.
