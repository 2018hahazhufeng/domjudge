This is the Programming Contest Jury System "DOMjudge" version 3.0.0SVN

DOMjudge is a system for running a programming contest, like the ACM
regional and world championship programming contests.


Administrator documentation
---------------------------

For more information on installation and requirements see the
documentation under the doc/admin directory. Run `make` there
to create HTML and PDF versions of the available documentation.

To get started with the Administrator documentation, this should
work on a Debian/Ubuntu system:
$ sudo apt-get install linuxdoc-tools make transfig texlive-latex-recommended
$ cd doc/admin
$ make

The documentation is also available online at the DOMjudge homepage:
http://domjudge.sourceforge.net/#documentation


User documentation
------------------

The doc/ directory also contains documentation for users of DOMjudge,
namely for jury members (under doc/judge) and teams (under doc/team).

The requirements to build the jury documentation are the same as the
requirements for building the administrator documentation (linuxdoc,
make, transfig and LaTeX).

To build the team documentation, DOMjudge has to be properly configured
first, as parts of the configuration are used in it (e.g. the URL to the
team interface of DOMjudge).

Additionally, the LaTeX packages `svn` and `expdlist` are also required
to build the team documentation. These packages can be installed as part
of LaTeX distributions such as TeX Live. On Debian-like systems, they can
be installed with:
$ sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
