DOMjudge INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==================================


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

This judging system was developed and tested on GNU/Linux systems,
specifically on Debian Woody and RedHat 9. We have tried to make it
reasonably portable to other Unix systems, but have not done any
tests, so nothing guaranteed...

For the deployment of this jury-system, there are some requirements:

- A TCP/IP network which connects all jury and team computers.
  Extra network security which restricts internet access and access to
  other services (ssh, mail, talk, etc..) is advisable, but not
  provided by this software.

TODO: list of necessary protocols between different parts of the system.

- One jury account with a homedirectory which is shared between all
  jury-computers (e.g. via NFS).
  
- Team accounts which are accessible via SSH on the jurycomputers
  (a ssh-key of the jury account should be installed on all team
   accounts to provide public-key access).

- (Local) root access on the jury-computers (preferably also on the
  shared homedirectory) for (un)mounting proc and installing some
  programs setuid-root.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

- gcc with standard libraries

- make

- For every supported programming language a compiler is needed,
  which can generate statically linked standalone executables.

- A webserver which supports PHP >= 4.1.0

- MySQL 3 Database and client software

- PHP >= 4.1.0, located in /usr/bin/php

- Bash 2, located in /bin/bash

- Statically compiled Bash 2 (included for Linux IA32)

- Perl 5 or higher, located in /usr/bin/perl

- A lot of standard (GNU) programs, a probably incomplete list:
	hostname, date, dirname, basename, touch, chmod, cp, mv, cat,
	grep, diff, wc, mkdir, mkfifo, mount, sleep, head, tail

- sudo

- OpenSSH/SCP (or a compatible ssh/scp client)
