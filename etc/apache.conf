# This is an example Apache configuration for DOMjudge.
# Replace SYSTEM_ROOT in this file with the path you set
# as SYSTEM_ROOT,i.e. where the DOMjudge scripts are located
# (it appears multiple times) and replace the server domain
# 'domjudge.example.com' by yours.

# Use this VirtualHost block if you want DOMjudge to live in
# the root of your webserver. See the Apache documentation for
# virtualhosts for more information.

# www.example.com/domjudge

#Alias /domjudge SYSTEM_ROOT/www
