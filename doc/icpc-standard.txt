DOMjudge and the ICPC Validator Interface Standard
--------------------------------------------------

DOMjudge (partially) supports the ICPC Validator Interface Standard,
which can be found at:

http://www.ecs.csus.edu/pc2/doc/valistandard.html

The invocation code ("judge/test_solution.h") adheres to the invocation
interface. It passes as a 5th optional parameter to the validator
program the filename in which it expects a difference output between
the program and jury output (parameters 2 and 3 respectively).

DOMjudge does _not_ completely adhere to the standard in the following
way: the exact contents of this difference output is not relevant, but
the judging system reports the output as correct, when this difference 
output is empty. The exitcode of the validator program should also be 
zero, otherwise an internal error is generated. DOMjudge itself does not 
use the generated XML output of the validator at all at this moment.

DOMjudge currently has one validator script: "judge/compare.sh". When 
passed a 5th parameter, this is interpreted as a filename to which it 
will write a 'diff' output of the program and jury output (in a readable 
format). It also generates XML compliant output, which is written to the
result file specified in parameter 4 and fully complies with the standard.
