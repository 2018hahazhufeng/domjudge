DOMjudge and the ICPC Validator Interface Standard
--------------------------------------------------

DOMjudge supports the ICPC Validator Interface Standard, which can be
found at:

	http://www.ecs.csus.edu/pc2/doc/valistandard.html

The invocation code ("judge/test_solution.h") adheres to the invocation
interface. It passes as a 5th optional parameter to the validator
program the filename in which it expects a difference output between
the program and jury output (parameters 2 and 3 respectively).

DOMjudge does only support the parsing of the result XML file (in the
result interface) if 'xsltproc' is available on the judge computers;
this program is part of the GNOME libxslt package
(http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT/). If this is not available, then DOMjudge
reports judging as correct, when the compare script difference output is
empty. The exitcode of the validator program should also be zero,
otherwise an internal error is generated.

DOMjudge currently has two validator scripts: "judge/compare.sh" and
"judge/compare_program.sh". The first does a compare with a a plain
diff, the second script calls an external program for checking (e.g.
"judge/check_float" for comparison of floating point results). When
passed a 5th parameter, this is interpreted as a filename to which these
scripts will write a comparison of the program and jury output. Both
scripts also generate XML compliant output, which is written to the
result file specified in parameter 4 and fully complies with the
validator standard.
