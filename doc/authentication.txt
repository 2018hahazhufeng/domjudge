Authentication of teams in DOMjudge
-----------------------------------

The jury system needs to know which team it is dealing with. This document
describes how we do that and what you can influence about it.

The IP-address of a workstation is the primary means of authentication. The
system assumes that someone coming from a specific IP is the team with that
IP listed in the team table.

When a team browses to the web interface, this is checked and the appropriate
team page is presented. The submitclient also checks this IP for the origin
of a submission.

There are three possible ways of configuring that IP-address:
1) Supply it beforehand.
   Before the contest starts, when entering teams into the database, add the
   IP that each team will have to that team's entry. When the teams arrive,
   everything will work directly and without further configuration (except
   when teams switch workplaces).
   If possible, this is the recommended modus operandi, because it's the
   least hassle just before and during the contest.

2) Supply the teams with a password with which to authenticate. Beforehand,
   generate passwords for each team in the jury interface. When the test
   session (or contest) starts and a team connects to the web interface
   and are an unknown IP, they will be prompted for username and password.
   Once supplied, the IP is stored and the password is not needed anymore
   for the rest of the contest.
   This is also a secure option, but requires a bit more hassle from the
   teams, and maybe from the organisers who have to distribute pieces of
   paper.
   Note: the web interface will only allow a team to authenticate
   themselves once. If an IP is set, a next authentication will be
   refused (to avoid trouble with lingering passwords). In order to fully
   reauthenticate a team, the IP address needs to be set to NULL in the
   database.

3) Have DOMjudge configure the IP upon first submission with the command line
   submit client. This is option STRICTIPCHECK which should be set to 0 to
   activate. In that case, we start out without IP's (and the web interface
   will not be accessible), but as soon as a team connects with the command
   line client, the IP is registered and everything works as normal.
   The connect can happen during the test session, so during the real contest
   everything is fully available.
   This is obviously somewhat less secure, but quite simple, especially in
   environments where the teams can be quite trusted or very small contests.
