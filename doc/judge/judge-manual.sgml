<chapt>DOMjudge Overview
<p>

DOMjudge is a system for running a programming contest, like the ACM
regional and world championship programming contests.

This means that teams are on-site and have a fixed time period (mostly
5 hours) and one computer to solve a number of problems (mostly 6-10).
Problems are solved by writing a program in one of the allowed
languages, that reads input according to the problem input
specification and writes the correct, corresponding output.

The judging is done by submitting the source code of the solution to
the jury. There the jury system automatically compiles and runs the
program and compares the program output with the expected output.

This software can be used to handle the submission and judging during
such contests. It also handles feedback to the teams and communication
on problems (clarification requests). It has webinterfaces for the
jury, the teams (their submissions and clarification requests) and the
public (scoreboard).

<chapt>General
<p>



<chapt>Before the contest
<p>


<chapt>During the contest
<p>


<sect>Clarification Requests
<p>
Communication between teams and jury happens through Clarification Requests. Everything
related to that happens under the Clarifications menu item.

<p>
Teams can use their web interface to send a clarification request to the jury. The jury
can send a response to that team specifically, or send it to all teams. The latter is
done to ensure that all teams have the same information about the problem set. The jury
can also send a clarification that does not correspond to a specific request. These will
be termed "general clarifications".

<p>
Under Clarifications, three lists are shown: new clarifications, answered clarifications
and general clarfications. It lists the team login, the time and an excerpt. Click the
excerpt for details about that clarification request.

<p>
Every incoming clarification request will initially be marked as unanswered. The menu
bar shows the number of unanswered requests. A request will be marked as answered when
a response has been sent. Additionally it's possible to mark a clarification request
as answered with the button that can be found when viewing the request. The latter
can be used when the request has been dealt with in some other way, for example by sending
a general message to all teams.

<p>
Answering a clarification request happens by putting the text in the input box under the
request text. The original text is quoted. You can choose to either send it to the team
that requested the clarification, or to all teams. In the latter case, make sure you phrase
it in such a way that it's understandable by itself, since the other teams do not know what
the original question was.

<p>




<chapt>After the contest
<p>
Once the contest is over, the system will still accept submissions but will not judge
them anymore. Teams will see this as a "too-late" response.
<p>
If the scoreboard was frozen, it will remain frozen until the time set as unfreeze time,
as seen under Contests. It is possible to publish the final standings at any given moment
by pressing the "unfreeze scoreboard now" button under contests.
<p>
There's not much more to be done after the contest has ended. The administrator will need
to take care of backing up all system data and submissions, and the awards ceremony can start.
