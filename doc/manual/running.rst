Running the contest
===================


Team status
```````````
Under the Teams menu option, you can get a general impression of the
status of each team: a traffic light will show either of the
following:

- gray: the team has not (yet) connected to the web interface at all;
- red: he team has connected but not submitted anything yet;
- yellow: one or more submissions have been made, but none correct;
- green: the team has made at least one submission that has
  been judged as correct.

This is especially useful during the practice session, where it is
expected that every team can make at least one correct submission. A
team with any other colour than green near the end of the session
might be having difficulties.


Clarification Requests
``````````````````````
Communication between teams and jury happens through Clarification
Requests. Everything related to that is handled under the
Clarifications menu item.

Teams can use their web interface to send a clarification request to
the jury. The jury can send a response to that team specifically, or
send it to all teams. The latter is done to ensure that all teams have
the same information about the problem set. The jury can also send a
clarification that does not correspond to a specific request. These
will be termed *general clarification*.

Under Clarifications, three lists are shown: new clarifications,
answered clarifications and general clarifications. It lists the team
login, the problem concerned, the time and an excerpt. Click the excerpt
for details about that clarification request.

Every incoming clarification request will initially be marked as
unanswered. The menu bar shows the number of unanswered requests. A
request will be marked as answered when a response has been sent.
Additionally it's possible to mark a clarification request as answered
with the button that can be found when viewing the request. The latter
can be used when the request has been dealt with in some other way,
for example by sending a general message to all teams.

An answer to a clarification request is made by putting the text in the
input box under the request text. The original text is quoted. You can
choose to either send it to the team that requested the clarification,
or to all teams. In the latter case, make sure you phrase it in such a
way that the message is self-contained (e.g. by keeping the quoted
text), since the other teams cannot view the original request.
