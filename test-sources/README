Test sources for DOMjudge
=========================

In this directory are several sources to test the DOMjudge system
after installation for correct functioning.

These files test various parts of the system: mostly whether the
judging backend funtions correctly for all languages, but also whether
the submission system can handle some irregular cases.

To test the system, run 'make check'. This will try to submit all
sources (excluding the stress tests). For this to work the system
should be completely configured and the submit- and judgedaemons
running. The default contest 'Demo contest' and problem 'Hello' can be
used for testing: files named 'test-hello.*' should give correct
answers on these. All other files should fail for different reasons,
which is described in these files respectively.

'make test-stress' will submit the stress tests, which may break the
system and require manual repair: be careful!
