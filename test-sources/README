Test sources for DOMjudge
=========================

In this directory are several sources to test the DOMjudge system
after installation for correct functioning.

These files test various parts of the system: mostly whether the
judging backend funtions correctly for all languages, but also whether
the submission system can handle some irregular cases.

To test the system, run 'make check'. This will try to submit all
sources (excluding the stress tests). For this to work the system
should be completely configured and the submit- and judgedaemons
running. The default contest 'Demo contest', problems 'Hello' and
'Fltcmp' can be used for testing. Files named 'test-hello.*' should
give correct answers on problem 'Hello'; all other files 'test-*'
should fail for different reasons, which is described in these files
respectively. The files 'fltcmp-test-*' are for problem 'Fltcmp'.

'make test-stress' will submit the stress tests, which may break the
system and require manual repair: be careful!

After running 'make check' you can either manually verify the results
or run 'make verify' which will execute 'check-judgings' to
automatically verify the results using the '@EXPECTED_RESULTS@:'
header in the sources.
