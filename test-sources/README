Test sources for DOMjudge
=========================

In this directory are several sources to test the DOMjudge system
after installation for correct functioning.

These files test various parts of the system: mostly whether the
judging backend funtions correctly for all languages, but also whether
the submission system can handle some irregular cases.

To test the system, run 'make check'. This will try to submit all
sources. For this to work the system should be completely configured
and the submit- and judgedaemons running. The default contest 'Demo
contest' and problem 'Hello' can be used for testing: files named
'test-hello.*' should give correct answers on these. All other files
should fail for different reasons, which is described in these files
respectively.
